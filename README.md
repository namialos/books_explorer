## Code Overview

### 1. `FetchService.swift`

The `FetchService` class handles API requests for searching and fetching books. It uses `async/await` to make asynchronous requests and supports pagination. The search task is cancellable, ensuring that ongoing searches can be terminated if a new search is started.

### 2. `Home.swift`

This view contains the search bar and displays the list of books. It also handles user interactions like initiating a search and loading more results when scrolling.

### 3. `BookRow.swift`

A reusable component that displays individual book details (cover image, title, and author) in the list.

### 4. `BookDetail.swift`

Displays detailed information about a selected book, including its cover image, title, author, and first publish year.

## Pagination

Books Explorer supports lazy loading with pagination. As you scroll through the list of books, the app will automatically load more books when the last item appears on the screen.

## Async Image Loading

`AsyncImage` is used to fetch and display book cover images asynchronously. A placeholder is shown while the image is loading.
